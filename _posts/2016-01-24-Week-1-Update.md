## 1. What did you do this past week?

This week we went over the syllabus and class expectations. We looked at code and learned a little bit about Python data structures and assertions. I'm optimistic about this outcome of this course; it seems very focused on real-world applications. I also enjoy how straightforward and explicit the lessons and the projects seem.

## 2. What's in your way?

Currently there is nothing in my way. We haven't started the first project yet so there isn't really any work to be blocked on. I'm pre-empting things that might later be in my way or at least slow me down such as account creation and technology installation. I've installed Python 3 and virtualenv; my GitHub class is already an educational account; I also created a Travis CI account. My current shortcomings or things that I anticipate having problems with are my frontend skills as Javascript is my weakest language. Not too worried though, I have plenty of time to get into it. 

## 3. What will you do next week?

Next week we'll get started on the first project and learn more about software engineering patterns in Python.


My general experience in the class has been very good so far. I particularly enjoy the fact that it's only one hour long so I can actually maintain a good level of concertation throughout the class period. I like that were using GitHub and Travis CI, mostly things that I already know how to use but would like to know more about.

My tip of the week is Sublime Text has some pretty sweet themes. If you have the package manager on Sublime, you can download some pretty nice ones. [Here](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme) is the one I'm currently using.

## 1. What did you do this past week?

This week we learned about unit testing and acceptance testing. In class we went over testing as a concept and the Python unit testing framework, how to use it and how it works. We also dived deeper into the project specifications and requirements. The implementation of a cache to calculate the maximum number of cycle used in the Collatz conjecture operatios in a given range of numbers. I have everything setup & I've been polling Piazza a little to more sure I don't miss anything in terms of updates to the requirements. Seems like we're not going to need to submit to Sphere anymore because the speed requirements have changed.

## 2. What's in your way?

Currently, just my laziness. I haven't really looked as deeply into the assignments as I should have this week. I definitely feel like I have ample resources and time to succeed in this class. The problem is that I just haven't really gotten around to doing everything I've been trying to do. I do definitely want to prioritize this class as it's an incredibly useful subject.

Also the career fair is this week. It's not really "in [my] way", but will take time and effort out of my week to start recruiting again. I'm excited for the opportunities. Software Engineering will definitely help me hone the skills I need to be an effective intern.

## 3. What will you do next week?

Next week I'll be writing the majority of the code that I need to write in order to get the Collatz project done. I'm going to enjoy working on the optimizations and the cache implementation. The actual algorithmic part doesn't seem too challenging as the Collatz Conjecture is really well-defined. I might be underestimating it a bit, but I've done almost everything we're doing before.

My experience in the class has been pretty good so far. I haven't been doing amazing on the quizzes as some of them are kinda tricky. Or rather sometimes I read the questions too fast. I am learning a good amount about the Python programming language which is cool. Altogether: feeling pretty good about the class!

My tip-of-the-week this week is a terminal shortcut! On Mac OS X, you'd like to open a file or a webpage from your terminal simply type: `open [protocol]://path/to/file`. So for websites type: `open http://google.com` or whatever website you'd like to open. For files simply type: `open ~/.bashrc` or whatever file you'd like to open.

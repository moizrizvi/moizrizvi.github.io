## 1. What did you do this past week?

This past week I completed the Collatz project. It surprisingly didn't take as much time as I'd expected. I was fairly proud of the code I wrote. I thought I did a good job having consistent, well-documented style that mimics the style of the boiler plate code we were given. I think that's important because I personally have had the motto of "coding like a chameleon" whenever you're working with an existing codebase or at least the skelton of a potential codebase. Usually the best practice is to write code that follows the uniform conventions of the codebase even if some ad-hoc optimizations could be made (this will almost always be true). That is to say that there is an inherent value in maintaining uniformity in any kind of work. I think that's true even if other developers are not currently working on it concurrently. Among the many reasons for this are that others may need to read and continue to develop on top of the existing code later on, that it would be easier to read and understand yourself if you had an intuitive and predictable structure, and that it allows for you to truly be proud of the code that you've written. The main thing to keep in mind if you're actually developing something important, the code you write will be read an order of magnitude more often that it'll be rewritten. Fully interalizing that idea helps keep your mind on the team level as it's the guiding principle behind many of the decisions you'll need to make early on.

## 2. What's in your way?

Currently my lateness to start. I should almost definitely start my projects earlier. Deadlines really make me appreciate the idea of school and the potential that one can have when one is well-disciplined. Unfortunately, I have not quite reached the level of discipline that I would like to be at in my work, but I can certainly see improvements. I'm glad to see that I am actually writing this blog on time. The fact that I am recognizing this need is a testament to that progress. This coming week will definitely be better than the last as I am going to start the next project soon. Starting early is among the steps I am taking to forge on past the block of drawn-out procrastination I've engaged in recently.

## 3. What will you do next week?

I will start the next project. I believe this one can be done with a partner. I will start looking for a partner as soon as possible. I am excited to get to work with someone on a project. I think that will be a valuable experience as it's very likely that you will work with other people if you're working at a company or as part of an organization in general. And the main purpose of git is for collaborative use, so it'll be nice to get to utilize its team functionality.

This week was a bit of a rough one. I started the project super late and it was not fun. Definitely not a recommended course of action for anyone. Avoid at all costs in the future. Lesson learned. I also need to slow down reading those quizzes. For one of the quizzes I skipped over the most important line of code that we were supposed to look at and got the question wrong as a result. Definitely a good case for being more careful.

My tip of the week is to use get [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) or "[Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)." It's a super interactive, customizable shell. Highly recommended if you'd like to make your life easier. It certainly has made my life easier.

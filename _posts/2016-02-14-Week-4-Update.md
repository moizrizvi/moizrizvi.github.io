## 1. What did you do this past week?

This past week I started the new Netflix project. Currently, I have something of a boilerplate project setup with the GitHub repo, Travis CI, etc. I'm rather excited to work on it as I'm particularly interested in predictive models and I remember really wanting to try to implement my own solution back when the the Netflix challenge was a really big deal a few years ago. I also learned about Python implementations of reduce functions. I don't know too much about it, but I'm a bit of a fan of functional programming and functional paradigms. After taking big data last semester, thinking in terms of map and reduce has become far more natural and I use both functions fairly often in my own Python programming.

## 2. What's in your way?

Currently there isn't an awful lot in my way. I think most of my indolence has mostly evaporated. This week is going to be incredibly busy for me personally, so the possibility of procrastinate on the project is certainly real. I will do my very best to try to work on it as early as possible in order to avoid the dire situation I put myself in last time. I really enjoy my development setup currently, but I think potentially switching over to PyCharm might speed up my work and make me more productive.

## 3. What will you do next week?

This up coming week I will complete the Netflix project. I have a few ideas for useful caches that can be used that I will likely add to the public repository. I'll likely take a look at what's already in the public repo for some inspiration to get pointed in the right direction. I'll probably be going to office hours this coming week in order to ensure that I understand exactly what to do for the project as soon as possible.

This past week was a little slow. I missed a day of class because I was sick so I feel a little behind. I asked a friend to catch me up though you can never quite get the same experience if you're not actually in the classroom. I'm feeling fairly optimistic about this project and everything to come.

The tip-of-the-week this week is my favorite Sublime Text keyboard shortcut: Cmd + D. When you've highlighted a word and want to select the next occurrence of the word in the file that you're working in press Cmd + D. You can do this as many times as you want until you have all of the occurrences. Super useful if you want to change multiple things at once.
